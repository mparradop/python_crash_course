Q: What's the difference btw an interpreted and a compiled programming language?
A: The key difference is when translation to machine code happens: a compiled language is translated before execution, creating a native executable that runs directly on the computer's hardware, while an interpreted language has a program called an interpreter that translates the code line-by-line during execution. 
Compiled code generally runs faster but is platform-specific, whereas interpreted code is slower but more portable and allows for rapid development. 


Q: What's a traceback?
A: A traceback is a record of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code


Variables are labels!, a variable references a certain value

Strings
A method is an action that is performed on a piece of data.

Whitespaces refers to any nonprinting characters, such as spaces, tabs, and eol symbols.
add a tab to text

    \t tab
    \n new line
    \

Removing prefixes
    string_variable.removeprefix('https://')


functions:
    title() #capital letter on each word
    upper()
    lower() #used to convert the string to lowercase before storing it.
    strip() #leaves the original string unchanged
f"" is for format, because Python formats the string bt replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value

about numbers
    integers
    floats
    underscores in numbers (to make numbers more readable): Python ignores the uderscores when storing these kinds of values.
        to Python, 1000 is the same as 1_000

Multiple assigment
    >>>x, y, z = 0, 0, 0 #initialize the variables x, y, and z to zero

Constants
    is a variable whose value stays the sme throughout the life of a program.
    CAPITAL_LETTERS to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed.

    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5

3.
List: collection of items in a particular order. Lists work well for storing collections of items that can change throughout the life of a program.
    a list  can hold anything of data type
    items can be unrelated among them.
    naming list in plural

    index postition start at 0, not 1

    adding elements o a list.
        append(), the element is added to the end of the list.
    inserting elements into a list
        insert(), 
            specify the index of the new element and the value of the new item. 
            The operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the right
    removing elements from a list
        del, you can remove an item from any position in a list if you know its index.
        pop(), removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it.
            list as a stack of items and poping one item off the top of the stack
        remove(), if you don't know the position but know the value, then use remove().
            you can also work with a value that's being removed from a list, and it will be accessible through the variable
            it deletes only the first occurence of the value you specify.
    organizing a list
        sort(), changges the order of the list permanently, alphabetic order and can never revert to the original order.
        sort(reverse=True)
        sorted(), lets you display your list in a particular order, but doesn't affect the actual order of the list.
        sorted(reverse=True) display a list in reverse-alphabetic order
    printing a list in reverse order
        list.reverse()
    finding the lenght of a list
        len(list)

4.
Looping is important because it is one of the most common ways a computer automates repetitive tasks.

count=0
for eggs in basket: #it is helpful to choose a meaningful name that represents a single item from the list. Using singular an plural respectively, helps a lot
    count=count +1
print(f'There are {count} eggs in the basket')

Indentation. Python uses indentation to determine how a line or group of lines, is related to the rest of the program.

range() function. generate a series of numbers.
off-by-one behavior -> start counting at the first value you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide.
Because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end value.

for value in range(1,6):
    print(value)
##the output starts at 1 and ends at 5

range(6) -> returns numbers 0 to 5

numbers = list(range(1,6))

range() can be used to skip numbers in a given range. If you pass a third argument to range(), python uses that value as a step size when gen numbers

even_numbers = list(range(2,11,2))
print(even_numbers)

## rememeber that the operator '//' provides an int result when dividing ##


TUPLES

Sometimes you want to create a list of items that cannot change. Tuples allow you to do just that. 
A tuple lloks just like a list, except you use parentheses instead of square brackets. 
Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by using each item's index, just as you would for a list.

# Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions

checking for equality
>>>car = 'bmw'
>>>car=='bmw'
True

ignoring case when checking for equality
>>>car = VolksWagen
>>>car.lower() == 'volkswagen'
True

checking for inequality
requested_toppings = 'mushrooms'

if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
    print('Hold the anchovies!')

Numerical comparisons.
>>>age =18
>>>age == 18
True
>>>age <= 21
True
>>>age > 21
False
----------\
answer = 17
if answer != 42:
    print('incorrect')

Checking multiple conditions
and
or

(age_0>=21) and (age_1>=21)

Checking whether a value is in a list or not

value in list

if value not in list:
