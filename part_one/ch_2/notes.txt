Q: What's the difference btw an interpreted and a compiled programming language?
A: The key difference is when translation to machine code happens: a compiled language is translated before execution, creating a native executable that runs directly on the computer's hardware, while an interpreted language has a program called an interpreter that translates the code line-by-line during execution. 
Compiled code generally runs faster but is platform-specific, whereas interpreted code is slower but more portable and allows for rapid development. 


Q: What's a traceback?
A: A traceback is a record of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code


Variables are labels!, a variable references a certain value

Strings
A method is an action that is performed on a piece of data.

Whitespaces refers to any nonprinting characters, such as spaces, tabs, and eol symbols.
add a tab to text

    \t tab
    \n new line
    \

Removing prefixes
    string_variable.removeprefix('https://')


functions:
    title() #capital letter on each word
    upper()
    lower() #used to convert the string to lowercase before storing it.
    strip() #leaves the original string unchanged
f"" is for format, because Python formats the string bt replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value

about numbers
    integers
    floats
    underscores in numbers (to make numbers more readable): Python ignores the uderscores when storing these kinds of values.
        to Python, 1000 is the same as 1_000

Multiple assigment
    >>>x, y, z = 0, 0, 0 #initialize the variables x, y, and z to zero

Constants
    is a variable whose value stays the sme throughout the life of a program.
    CAPITAL_LETTERS to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed.

    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5

3.
List: collection of items in a particular order.
    a list  can hold anything of data type
    items can be unrelated among them.
    naming list in plural

    index postition start at 0, not 1
