#think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a list, 
# and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

pizzas = ['hawaian', 'burrata', 'pepperoni', 'four cheese']

for pizza in pizzas:
    print(f'A {pizza.title()} has been added to the order')

print(f'A total of {len(pizzas)} pizzas were ordered') #add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop
