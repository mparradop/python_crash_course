Q: What's the difference btw an interpreted and a compiled programming language?
A: The key difference is when translation to machine code happens: a compiled language is translated before execution, creating a native executable that runs directly on the computer's hardware, while an interpreted language has a program called an interpreter that translates the code line-by-line during execution. 
Compiled code generally runs faster but is platform-specific, whereas interpreted code is slower but more portable and allows for rapid development. 


Q: What's a traceback?
A: A traceback is a record of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code


Variables are labels!, a variable references a certain value

Strings
A method is an action that is performed on a piece of data.

Whitespaces refers to any nonprinting characters, such as spaces, tabs, and eol symbols.
add a tab to text

    \t tab
    \n new line
    \

Removing prefixes
    string_variable.removeprefix('https://')


functions:
    title() #capital letter on each word
    upper()
    lower() #used to convert the string to lowercase before storing it.
    strip() #leaves the original string unchanged
f"" is for format, because Python formats the string bt replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value
